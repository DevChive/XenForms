Grant of Rights (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and  limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free  copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution,  and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you create. (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations  in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under  its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose  of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.</p>

    <p>3. Conditions and Limitations (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks. (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically. (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software. (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license. (E) The software is licensed &quot;as-is.&quot; You bear the risk of using it. The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</p>

For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise  designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</p>

    <p> &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and  subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>

    <p> 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>

    <p> 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate  as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

    <p> 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You  meet the following conditions:</p>

    <p> (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

    <p> (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices  stating that You changed the files; and</p>

    <p> (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of  the Derivative Works; and</p>

    <p> (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed  as modifying the License.</p>

    <p> You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with  the conditions stated in this License.</p>

    <p> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>

    <p> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

    <p> 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>

    <p> 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <p> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
